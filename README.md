## _Barclays Launches Open Banking_

September 2018, Barclays launches their open bank feature.  Using APIs Barclays is now able to offer their services through other banks. Currently you can bank with (Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Lloyds, Nationwide, NatWest, RBS, Santander) using the Barclays app or website and have access to all your information. The argument switching to an open banking platform is self-described by the bank as an ‘aim to increase competition and innovation in financial products. 
The idea behind open banking is similar to buying airline tickets from a third-party seller. You are able to see the prices from multiple airlines to get the best prices for the specific dates you are looking for. Barclays is able to communicate with the API of all their partners so potential customers can search for the best bank or service for their situation. Along with the convenience that comes with searching for these services from a single banking institution, Barclays allows you to use their app to access your account and information all from the same app.

There are other companies that are developing open banking methods such as HSBC and ING. One main difference with these other companies is they use a completely different app. You would have to download a completely different app to have access to all the APIs these companies are associated with. By implementing their own app to the open banking system, Barclays makes it convenient by just using their own app and not having to download a completely different application to your phone or computer.

Barclays currently has 24 million customers. The success of their open banking platform will be determined by how many customers are added, and the overall satisfaction with the service. As other banks try to improve their technology and online presence Barclays will need to continue to innovate to stay ahead in the online convenience game. The main suggestion I would have isn’t necessarily on the tech side of this endeavor, but on the business side. Now that there is the ability to aggregate all kinds of banking information the next step would be to increase the size of the umbrella your company is casting. Add as many banks as possible, not only in England, but try to find ways to have this feature in other countries. Find all the institutions that are willing to agree to partner with you and attract people in other countries that don’t have access to the features that would be provided by Barclays. With the ability to communicate with various APIs, my next step would be to scale up.
